## FAQ
>‚≠ê if you agree and are willing to strictly abide by the rules of **LPU Org**, you are welcome to join our organization:

- **What is a GitHub Organization?** Essentially it's a way to group many repositories in an entity called an organization. An organization also allows us to group people who contribute and are a part of the community. Some examples would be: [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix), [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook) and of course [LPU-Org](https://github.com/LPU-Org).
Learn more on [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations).
